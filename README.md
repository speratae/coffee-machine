## Changes Made

### Solid Principles Integration

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each class has a single responsibility:
     - `MakeDrinkCommand`: Responsible for handling user input, selecting the appropriate drink strategy, and executing the order.
     - `MakeDrink`: Represents the strategy interface, defining methods for making drinks, adding sugar, and making drinks extra hot.
     - `MakeTea`, `MakeCoffee`, `MakeChocolate`: Concrete implementations of `MakeDrink`, each responsible for making a specific type of drink.
     - `ValidateOrder`: Responsible for error handling.

2. **Open/Closed Principle**
     - New drink types can now be added easily by creating a new concrete strategy class that extends the `MakeDrink` abstract class without modifying existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**
   - Subtypes (concrete drink strategy classes) can be substituted for their base type (`MakeDrink`) without affecting the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle**
   - `MakeDrink` implements the methods `makeDrink`, `addSugar`, `makeExtraHot` to ensure that concrete strategies only need to implement the methods relevant to them.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
     - `MakeDrinkCommand` depends on the abstraction (`MakeDrink`) rather than concrete implementations (`MakeTea`, `MakeCoffee`, `MakeChocolate`).
